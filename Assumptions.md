# OpenSesame Predictor - Key Assumptions & Design Decisions

This document outlines the core assumptions and design decisions made during the development of the OpenSesame API call prediction service.

## üéØ Core Operational Assumptions

### 1. **Stateless Prediction Model**
- **Assumption**: Each prediction request is independent and self-contained
- **Implication**: No user session state is maintained server-side
- **Rationale**: Simplifies scaling and reduces memory requirements
- **Trade-off**: Cannot leverage cross-session learning patterns

### 2. **English Language Focus**
- **Assumption**: Input prompts are primarily in English
- **Implication**: NLP models and patterns optimized for English text
- **Rationale**: Simplifies initial implementation and training data generation
- **Future**: Multi-language support can be added with localized models

### 3. **Limited Conversation Context**
- **Assumption**: Maximum 100 conversation history events per request
- **Implication**: Recent interactions weighted more heavily than older ones
- **Rationale**: Balances context awareness with processing performance
- **Benefit**: Prevents unbounded memory growth and processing delays

### 4. **Speed Over Perfect Accuracy**
- **Assumption**: Sub-second response time is more important than 100% accuracy
