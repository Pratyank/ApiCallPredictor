# OpenSesame Predictor - Key Assumptions & Design Decisions

This document outlines the core assumptions and design decisions made during the development of the OpenSesame API call prediction service. These assumptions form the foundation of our Phase 5 performance-optimized architecture targeting sub-800ms response times with comprehensive safety guardrails.

## 🎯 Core Operational Assumptions

### 1. **Stateless Prediction Model**
- **Assumption**: Each prediction request is independent and self-contained with no user profile storage
- **Implication**: No user session state is maintained server-side; stateless FastAPI design
- **Rationale**: Simplifies horizontal scaling, reduces memory requirements, enhances privacy
- **Trade-off**: Cannot leverage cross-session learning patterns or personalized recommendations
- **Architecture Impact**: Enables container-based deployment with linear scaling characteristics
- **Privacy Benefit**: Minimizes data retention risk and compliance overhead

### 2. **English Language Focus**
- **Assumption**: Input prompts are primarily in English language text
- **Implication**: NLP models, sentence-transformers, and safety patterns optimized for English
- **Rationale**: Reduces complexity in initial implementation and training data generation
- **Performance Impact**: Allows optimized caching and pattern recognition for English semantics
- **Future Extensibility**: Multi-language support can be added with localized models and validation patterns
- **Current Limitation**: Non-English prompts may receive suboptimal predictions

### 3. **Limited Conversation Context (100 Events Maximum)**
- **Assumption**: Maximum 100 conversation history events per prediction request
- **Implication**: Recent interactions weighted more heavily; older context truncated
- **Rationale**: Balances context awareness with processing performance and memory constraints
- **Performance Benefit**: Prevents unbounded memory growth and processing delays
- **Processing Impact**: Feature extraction remains O(n) where n ≤ 100
- **Quality Trade-off**: Long conversation threads may lose early context relevance

### 4. **Speed Over Perfect Accuracy Priority**
- **Assumption**: Sub-800ms response time is more important than 100% prediction accuracy
- **Implication**: Aggressive caching, parallel processing, and timeout-based fallbacks
- **Rationale**: Better user experience with 85% accuracy in <800ms vs 95% accuracy in 3+ seconds
- **Optimization Strategy**: Phase 5 parallel AI/ML processing with intelligent caching
- **Performance Targets**: LLM <500ms, ML <100ms, Total <800ms response times
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintains prediction relevance while optimizing for speed

### 5. **Synthetic Training Data Sufficiency (Ethics-First Approach)**
- **Assumption**: Synthetic data generation provides sufficient bootstrap training without real user data
- **Ethical Rationale**: Avoids privacy concerns, user consent issues, and data collection overhead
- **Implementation**: 10,000+ Markov chain-generated SaaS workflow sequences for ML training
