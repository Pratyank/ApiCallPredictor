# Cost-Aware Model Router Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Cost-Aware Model Router implementation for the OpenSesame Predictor project. The implementation was completed using a Hive Mind Collective Intelligence approach, coordinating multiple specialized agents to deliver a production-ready cost optimization system.

## Project Overview

### Objective
Implement a bonus feature for the OpenSesame Predictor that intelligently routes API calls to different Anthropic models (Claude 3 Haiku vs Claude 3 Opus) based on query complexity and budget constraints, while maintaining performance targets and prediction accuracy.

### Key Requirements
- Create `CostAwareRouter` class with model cost definitions
- Implement complexity-based routing logic
- Track budget consumption in SQLite database
- Maintain k+buffer (k=3, buffer=2) candidate processing
- Ensure performance targets: LLM < 500ms, total < 800ms
- Apply PEP 8 formatting standards
- Create comprehensive test suite

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. CostAwareRouter Class (`app/models/cost_aware_router.py`)
```python
class CostAwareRouter:
    """
    Intelligent model router that selects Anthropic models based on:
    - Query complexity scores
    - Available budget constraints
    - Performance requirements
    - Quality thresholds
    """
```

**Key Features:**
- **Model Registry**: Defines cost and accuracy for each model
  - Claude 3 Haiku: $0.00025/token, 70% accuracy (cheap)
  - Claude 3 Opus: $0.015/token, 90% accuracy (premium)
- **Routing Strategies**: FAST, BALANCED, PREMIUM modes
- **Budget Tracking**: Real-time cost monitoring with SQLite persistence
- **Emergency Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when approaching budget limits

#### 2. Integration Points

**AI Layer Enhancement (`app/models/ai_layer.py`):**
- Added complexity scoring algorithm
- Integrated cost router for model selection
- Enhanced response metadata with cost information
- Maintained backward compatibility

**Predictor Integration (`app/models/predictor.py`):**
- Seamless integration with existing k+buffer strategy
- Cost-aware candidate generation
- ML ranking compatibility preserved
- Safety filtering maintained

#### 3. Database Schema Extensions

**New Tables in `data/cache.db`:**
```sql
-- Budget tracking
CREATE TABLE budget_consumption (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    date TEXT NOT NULL,
    model_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    query_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_cost REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    avg_complexity REAL DEFAULT 0.0
);

-- Performance metrics
CREATE TABLE model_performance (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    model_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    complexity_range TEXT NOT NULL,
    avg_response_time REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    success_rate REAL DEFAULT 1.0,
    cost_efficiency REAL DEFAULT 0.0
);

-- Router configuration
CREATE TABLE router_settings (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    setting_name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    setting_value TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Implementation Methodology: Hive Mind Collective Intelligence

### Why Hive Mind Approach?

The project utilized a sophisticated multi-agent coordination system to maximize development efficiency and quality:

#### 1. Specialized Agent Roles
- **ðŸ”¬ Research Agent**: Architecture analysis and best practices research
- **ðŸ’» Implementation Agent**: Core development and coding
- **ðŸ”— Integration Agent**: System integration and documentation
- **ðŸ§ª Testing Agent**: Comprehensive validation and testing

#### 2. Coordination Benefits
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focused on their domain
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-layer validation and review
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: No aspect overlooked

#### 3. Technical Coordination
- **Memory Sharing**: Common knowledge base across agents
- **Hook Integration**: Coordination checkpoints and synchronization
- **Conflict Resolution**: Consensus-based decision making
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates

## Technical Implementation Details

### Complexity Scoring Algorithm

The router uses a multi-dimensional complexity scoring system:

```python
def calculate_complexity_score(self, prompt: str, history: List = None) -> float:
    """
    Multi-factor complexity analysis:
    - Token count (30% weight)
    - Semantic complexity (40% weight) 
    - Context size (20% weight)
    - Query ambiguity (10% weight)
    """
```

**Complexity Thresholds:**
- Simple (0.0-0.4): Route to Claude 3 Haiku
- Medium (0.4-0.7): Route to Claude 3 Sonnet (if available)
- Complex (0.7-1.0): Route to Claude 3 Opus

### Budget Management System

**Real-time Tracking:**
- Daily budget limits (default: $100)
- Per-query cost estimation
- Cumulative spending monitoring
- Alert thresholds at 75%, 90%, 95%

**Cost Calculation:**
```python
# Anthropic pricing model (2025)
ANTHROPIC_PRICING = {
    'claude-3-haiku': {'input': 0.25, 'output': 1.25},    # per 1M tokens
    'claude-3-opus': {'input': 15.0, 'output': 75.0}      # per 1M tokens
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Caching Strategy
- Router decision caching (5-minute TTL)
- Database connection pooling
- Complexity score memoization

#### 2. Async Processing
- Non-blocking budget checks
- Parallel complexity scoring
- Asynchronous database operations

#### 3. Fallback Mechanisms
- Model unavailability handling
- Budget exhaustion graceful degradation
- Network failure recovery

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests** (25 tests): Core functionality validation
2. **Integration Tests** (10 tests): System compatibility
3. **Performance Tests** (8 tests): Latency and throughput
4. **Edge Cases** (12 tests): Error handling and robustness

**Key Test Scenarios:**
